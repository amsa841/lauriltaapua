# Laurilta apua

This is a simple web application where people can add their names to a help queue and update their status (whether they need help or not). It's designed to help manage a help queue system and show a list of names that need assistance.

## Features

- Users can add their name to the queue.
- Each user can change their status to "Sain apua" (Got help) or "En tarvitse enää apua" (No longer need help).
- Users can see the list of others waiting for help.
- Names are saved in local storage, and the queue is updated automatically.
- The queue is reset when the "Päivitä lista" (Refresh list) button is pressed.

## How to Use

1. Open the website.
2. Type your name in the input field and click the "Lisää nimi" (Add Name) button to add yourself to the queue.
3. When you get help, click the "Sain apua" (Got help) button.
4. If you no longer need help, click the "En tarvitse enää apua" (No longer need help) button.
5. Refresh the queue by clicking "Päivitä lista" (Refresh list).
